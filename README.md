# The PT App 

## Purpose & Features
The purpose of this site is to help Personal Trainers become more accessible, to help PTs promote themselves and gain clientel with more ease than resources that are currently available. This site helps answer the question, where do I find a new Personal Trainer without searching social mdeia platforms and not through word of mouth? And gives new, more junior PTs a great platform to expose themselves to potential clients - whilst also adding benefit to more experienced PTs to further grow their client pool.

Lighthouse report shows really good results. After initially running this report, it brought to light missing 'alt' tags in the <img> tags across the sight.
The performance result is very poor, but after using code institute template, and following all require steps by following the provided walkthrough videos, I am unsure as to the result being so low. Also to debug and try and improve upon this, is something that is out of the remit of this project and was not taught.
